# z01-clonernews

Clonernews is a 1 day project made during Zone01 Javascript piscine. The goal is to build a simple web interface for [HackerNews](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) , an open API that users use to share articles and discuss about different topics.

## How to use

The project can be opened with any browser.

## Features

- 2 different pages for job and news posts.
- 1 page to display an old poll as an example, as polls are most likely abandoned by HackerNews community.
- A simple post display, including title, author, date, and eventually article link and text content.
- Posts' comments and comments' comments.
- A pop-up informing the user that a new post has been created. Page must be reloaded.

## Project status

Project has been validated during zone01 Javascript piscine, and as a 1 day project, is not intended to be modified any further. The main goal of the project was to learn about using an API, with proper fetch management without spamming the API, and this is done correctly here. Comments are not displayed as intended from newest to oldest, which could be solved by more carefully sorting comments before displaying them.
